# SQL Query IMDB Dataset Analysis

Welcome to a data-driven exploration of the IMDB movie dataset using powerful SQL queries and Python in Google Colab.

This project dives into the entertainment industry's data — uncovering insights about directors, genres, revenues, and ratings using SQL logic and Python's data handling capabilities.

## Project Highlights

Performed advanced **SQL queries** directly on a `.sqlite` database  
Analyzed movie trends, revenues, and top-performing directors  
Used **Python (pandas)** for displaying query results in structured format  
Built and run entirely in **Google Colab** for simplicity and accessibility

---

## Key Insights

Top 10 directors by total revenue and number of movies  
Yearly revenue trends across all genres  
Highest rated movies filtered by runtime and votes  
Revenue vs. Rating patterns using SQL filters and grouping
